## Cypress
The job `integration-tests` inside the GitHub workflow file [ci.yml](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) is used to run the integration tests in GitHub Actions.

All Cypress test cases are written in the Plio Frontend repository.

Refer [Cypress documentation](https://github.com/avantifellows/plio-frontend/blob/master/docs/CYPRESS.md) in the Plio Frontend repository for more details on the integration testing in Plio.
